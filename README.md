##  Overview  
A real-time coordination system built to manage disaster response using **AI-driven insights**, **geospatial queries**, and **live updates**.  
It consolidates citizen reports, relief resources, and official data into a single, intelligent platform.

---

##  Motivation  
During disasters, information is scattered across multiple platforms ‚Äî social media, news, and official sites.  
My motivation was to build a unified system that merges these streams, enhances them with AI, and helps responders act faster with reliable, location-based intelligence.

---

##  Problem It Solves  
- **Centralizes** real-time data from citizens, authorities, and social media.  
- **Extracts** and verifies locations or images using Google **Gemini AI**.  
- **Maps** nearby resources with **Supabase/Postgres geospatial queries**.  
- **Broadcasts** live updates via **Socket.IO**.  
- **Caches** data intelligently to reduce redundant API calls.

##  Tech Stack  

| Category | Technology |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | React.js |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js |
| **Database** | Supabase (PostgreSQL + Geospatial) |
| **AI Integration** | Google Gemini API |
| **Real-time** | Socket.IO |
| **Caching & Storage** | Supabase JSONB |
| **Maps/Geocoding** | Google Maps API / OpenStreetMap |
| **Deployment** | Render / Fly.io / Railway (Backend), Vercel / Netlify (Frontend) |

##  Features  
- üß† **AI-Powered Location Extraction:** Extracts coordinates from text using Gemini.  
- üñºÔ∏è **Image Verification:** Validates authenticity through AI models.  
- üó∫Ô∏è **Geospatial Resource Mapping:** Finds resources near disaster areas.  
- ‚ö° **Realtime Updates:** Broadcasts events using Socket.IO.  
- üì∞ **Official Updates Scraper:** Fetches verified government/NGO reports.  
- üíæ **Smart Caching:** Optimizes response time with Supabase caching.  
- üí¨ **Mock Social Feed:** Simulates citizen updates for testing.

---

##  What I Learned  
- Designing **AI-integrated backend systems** with multiple APIs.  
- Writing **geospatial SQL queries** and Supabase RPC functions.  
- Handling **real-time communication** efficiently with Socket.IO.  
- Deploying backend-heavy apps using **cloud-native tools**.  

---

##  What Makes It Stand Out  
- AI + Geospatial + Real-time ‚Äî all integrated in one system.  
- Backend-first architecture optimized for reliability and scalability.  
- Intelligent caching and indexing for speed and efficiency.  
- Minimal frontend, but powerful backend workflows designed for real-world disaster coordination.

## Quick Start  

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env   # Fill in environment variables
npm install
npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:5000
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
# Runs on http://localhost:3000

### Environment Variables (Backend)
```bash
PORT=5000
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=
```

FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

### Database Setup
```bash
ables: disasters, resources, reports, cache
Spatial columns: disasters.location, resources.location
Indexes: GIST (spatial), GIN (tags)
RPC: nearby_resources(lon, lat, radius_m, p_disaster_id)
SQL file: backend/database-setup.sql
```
